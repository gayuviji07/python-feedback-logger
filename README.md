# Mini project python file handling project 
## project title:
" Feedback Logger with csv Reporting"
## project Description:
This project demonstrates the practical use of Python file handling by allowing users to submit feedback through a command-line interface (CLI). Each feedback entry is stored in a text file with a timestamp and username. Later, the program filters specific feedback entries containing keywords like "BUG" or "ERROR" and exports them to a summary CSV report.

## key Features:
✅ Collect user feedback interactively via CLI

✅ Store each feedback entry with timestamp and name in feedback_log.txt

✅ Filter feedback entries containing keywords like "BUG" or "ERROR"

✅ Export filtered results to feedback_summary.csv

✅ Clean and simple interface for beginners
